0.08    2014-04-01

- This version now works with both List::MoreUtils 0.28-0.33 and the latest
  trial version, 0.400_006. Note that it does not work with earlier versions
  of 0.400.


0.07    2013-10-14

- The last version totally broke all exports from List::MoreUtils. Now there
  are actual tests for this. Reported by Tatsuhiko Miyagawa. RT #89509.


0.06    2013-10-14

- List::Util 1.33 provides some subs that are also provided by
  List::MoreUtils. This caused subroutine redefeined warnings. List::AllUtils
  now only imports subs from List::MoreUtils that aren't defined by
  List::Util. This works with List::Util 1.31+. Reported by Zefram. RT #89467.


0.05    2013-08-30

- Really require List::Util 1.31, instead of just saying so in the
  Changes. Reported by Przemysław Wesołek. RT #88296


0.04    2013-08-25

- Updated to require List::Util 1.31, which includes a bunch of new pairwise
  functions.


0.03    2012-02-21

- Updated docs to match List::MoreUtils 0.28+. Reported by ilmari. RT #75196.


0.02   2009-09-12

- Added a generated Makefile.PL. Fixes RT #48805.

- Code tweak so that this module will always export everything exported by
  List::Util, even if that module adds new functions.


0.01   2009-01-23

- First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
